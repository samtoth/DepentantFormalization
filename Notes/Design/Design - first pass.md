There are a few general points of concern when regarding the large scale design of this proof assistant, namely:

- [[The Core Language]]
	How general/extensible should it be? How large should it be? What features should it emphasize or take for granted?

- [[The graphical-notational system]]
	 How can we make it extensible? Can we reuse existing tools? How should the user interact with it? How can we guide users into writing content that is made more clear by notation?

- [[UI UX]]
	More generally, how can we make a tool where user experience and interaction is made a priority? This should includes features built on top of the core theory: e.g. module systems; code organization and code search; meta-programming and tactics; sophisticated elaboration.
