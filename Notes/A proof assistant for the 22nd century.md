ðŸ’¡ There is still work to be done in the human interaction side of proof assistants.

ðŸ’¡ We should be able to communicate our ideas in a level of abstraction that is familiar to mathematicians but at the same time precise enough to communicate to a computer. This is an inherent tension.

ðŸ’¡ Ideas written on a paper must be static. This restriction is lifted in a digital medium. The appropriate level of terseness may vary not only by the author but also of the reader. If the complete information is given, then the reader can choose their own level of detail.

ðŸ’¡Complete information is needed in the representation; however, no author wantâ€™s to be forced to constantly state the obvious. If authoring in a proof assistant is a conversation with the computer, then the more the computer is able to infer, the easier the life of the writer is. A question arises should we separate authoring to a computer and authoring to a human reader. The answer is probably yes.

ðŸ’¡ User defined syntax/notation can be extremely powerful (EDSLâ€™s as a programming paradigm - sometimes called Language Oriented Programming). But with great power comes great responsibility. Notation should only be used iff it aids the efficiency and clarity of communication.

ðŸ’¡Visual layout is important. Subtle differences in kerning/spacing can be the difference between information dense and clear verses dense but completely indigestible. This has been well studied and is a well understood problem (look to LaTeX). Also look to sheet music - Elain Gould behind bards as an example of the detail and thought put into subtle layout matters to epitomize information density vs clarity.

ðŸ’¡ Lotâ€™s of wheels are reinvented when new type theories are designed. Many theories can fall under MLTT with subtle changes/additions. But not all. So if we are to provide an extensible core type theory - there is a tension between how general can this be whilst still being useful.

ðŸ’¡ Maybe ascii text isnâ€™t the final form/ only suitable representation of our ideas.
